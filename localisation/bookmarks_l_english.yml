  ENG_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Der ,Teutone` und Preußen sind eine Bedrohung für dir Zivilisation, ein Hort der Unfreiheit, der Obrigkeitshörigkeit, des Militarismus und der Gewalt. Unser Imperium wird von diesen und den Franzosen gefährdet. Der Franzose jaja. Wir werden dafür sorgen das wir nicht den Thron an Deutschland oder den Franzmann abgeben."
  FRA_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Wir werden uns den Elsaß zurückholen. Wir müssen. Die Schmach hängt uns noch so hinterher. Verdammte Deustche und auch jetzt sind sie militärisch aufgebaut. Wenn wir doch noch ein paar Kolonnien kriegen könnten. Die Briten stehen allem im Weg. Aber wir werden wieder eine Weltmacht, ein Frazösisches Imperium. Mit Russland an unsere Seite."
  GER_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "Germany rises. It's been several years since the formation of the German Empire(1871) and I Wilhelm II have made this militarily and economically invincible. The French think that we have forgotten the attempt to sabotage the rise of Prussia. Never! And of course the scaredy cats had to side with the biggest nation. First off we need to strengthen or ranks. Sadly we don't have any allies in Europe. All the other nations are working against us. The only hope would be Austro-Hungary. This second german State must be protected."
  ITA_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Mit unserer riesigen wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung und unserer entwickelten Organisation sind wir vom Agrarstaat ,neben Österreich-Ungarn und Frankreich zu einem der Indistriuel stärksten Kräfte in Europa geworden. Im Dreibund mit den Duetschland und Östereich Ungarn sind wir gegen den Rest der Welt doch auch wir brauchen Kolonialeausbreitung. Aber wollen wir wirklich mit Deutschland käpfen. Mein Vater Umberto I war fest von Deutschland überzeugt, ich zweifle, dass dieses Bündnis Italien irgendwie weiterbringt.#Derp"
  JAP_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Das Japanische Kaiserreich befindet sich an einem Scheideweg. Hokushin-ron, die Nordexpansion-Doktrin, wird von der Armee bevorzugt und sieht einen Vorstoß nach Sibirien vor. Nanshin-ron, die Südexpansion-Doktrin, wird von der Marine unterstützt und hat die reichen europäischen Kolonien in Südostasien und den Pazifik als Ziel. \n\nUnd dann ist da natürlich noch China. Japan besitzt ein eindrucksvolles Militär, doch seine Industrie darbt nach Ressourcen und die Zeit läuft langsam ab. Welchen Weg soll man gehen?"
  SOV_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Das Russiche Kaisereich ist zerissen viele wollen Reformen doch das Land ist durch die autokratische Herrschaft des Zaren unterdrückt und eine Revolution kässt nur auf sich warten. Dazu haben wir Konflikte mit Östereich Ungarn in den Balkan Staaten. Dabei müsste ihnen klar sein das z.B. die Serben das selbe Blut, die gleiche Religion und die insgesamt die Slavische Kultur in sich tragen und damit unsere Brüder sind. "
  USA_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "[translation comming soon]Nach dem letzten Krieg isolierten sich die Vereinigten Staaten und genossen sie in den wilden Zwanzigern eine Phase des wirtschaftlichen Wohlstands. Dies fand ein dramatisches Ende, als die Nation von der Großen Depression erfasst wurde.\n\nBis dahin hatte Amerikas Politik der Nichteinmischung in ausländische Kriege standgehalten. Doch die Spannungen in Europa und Asien werden immer größer. Der Große Neutrale könnte mit in den Mahlstrom hineingezogen werden, ob er will oder nicht."
  OTHER_VERSAGEN_DIPLOMATIE_DESC:0 "The nations of the world big and small aren't satisfied with holding their breath and just waiting for the eruption of a global conflict. From major powers that are at the brink of a civil war. \n\n... All will have to make hard decisions and will have to choose between ideals and pragmatism to be able to influence the future of this world."
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
